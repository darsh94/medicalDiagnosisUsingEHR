# medicalDiagnosisUsingEHR
The project involves using Natural Language Processing Techniques and machine learning techniques to learn the word embeddings of the terms 
in a patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). 
SVM and Naive Bayes are then used to predict the medical speciality to which a patient's EHR belongs to, by utilizing the word embeddings learnt.
